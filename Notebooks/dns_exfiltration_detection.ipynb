    "# DNS Exfiltration Detection Using Python and Pandas: A Network Traffic Analytics Approach\n",
    "By Herbert Maosa  \n",
    "Cybersecurity Consultant | PhD | CISSP | OSCP\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\"***Most networks let DNS traffic pass without a second thought — and that's exactly what attackers are counting on***.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**DNS exfiltration** is a stealthy cyberattack in which sensitive data — such as passwords, source code, or trade secrets — is smuggled out of a network inside DNS queries. Since DNS traffic is rarely blocked or closely scrutinized, attackers can encode payloads into domain lookups and quietly bypass firewalls. The exfiltrated data often travels in query names or payloads, unnoticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting DNS exfiltration involves identifying subtle anomalies, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Excessively long or random-looking domain names\n",
    "- High volumes of DNS queries to suspicious or rarely seen domains\n",
    "- Unusual query types or response behaviors\n",
    "- Regular time intervals between queries\n",
    "- Queries occurring at abnormal times (e.g., nights/weekends)\n",
    "- High entropy or randomness in query names\n",
    "- Excessive subdomains under a single root domain\n",
    "- Anomalous distributions of response codes and types\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I present a framework for detecting data exfiltration over DNS. It is designed to be an evolving resource — enriched with new analyses as I encounter them in real-world threat hunts. The goal is to bridge theory and practice using Python, Pandas, and real PCAP data to demonstrate how even stealthy DNS traffic can reveal a breach in progress."

    "For this Notebook, we analyze the [CIC-Bell-DNS-EXF-2021 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/dns-exf-2021.html) by the Canadian Institute of Cyber Security- a well-known benchmark in cybersecurity research, particularly for DNS exfiltration detection. This dataset is provided in two formats:\n",
    "- A CSV file with ~30 pre-engineered features for machine learning\n",
    "- A raw PCAP file containing full packet captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the PCAP includes other protocols, we focused exclusively on DNS traffic to investigate potential exfiltration activity. The PCAPS containing the attacks are further divided into *text, audio, video, images,* and *compressed*, depending on what the attack is doing. In this blog, we are only analysing the text PCAP payload, for illustration of the analytics. Feel free to extend the analytics and test them on the other attacks as well.\n",
    "The PCAP is initially dissected using our own python script, ```pcap_parser.py```, which you will find in the projects' [github repository](https://github.com/hmaosa/dns-exfiltration-detection). The processed output is stored in a structured JSON file, which we then load into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the notebook and separate concerns, we’ve moved the heavy lifting code—such as PCAP ingestion and DNS log processing—into dedicated helper scripts. These scripts handle tasks like parsing PCAP files and transforming the DNS traffic into an analyzable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the essential code for visualization and analysis is retained in the notebook for clarity. You can access all helper scripts on the project's GitHub page."

    "Attackers often attempt to evade detection by spacing out DNS queries at regular intervals — a technique known as beaconing. To analyze this, we calculate the time between successive queries from the same source IP. Beaconing behavior is a common tactic used by malware to maintain communication with a command-and-control (C2) server. It typically involves a host sending out periodic, automated requests—often over DNS—to check in or receive commands. This regularity in communication timing forms the basis for detection. To identify such behavior, we begin by analyzing the distribution of time intervals between successive DNS requests.\n",

    "\n",
    "DNS response types can reveal data exfiltration attempts, as attackers often misuse them to bypass security controls. Here is a brief breakdown of the significance of the various response types to data exfiltration over DNS analysis:  \n",
    "- **TXT**: Commonly abused to carry arbitrary data; monitor for large or frequent responses.\n",
    "- **NULL**: Rarely used legitimately; high risk due to ability to carry binary payloads.\n",
    "- **CNAME**: Used for domain redirection or chaining; look for long or suspicious chains.\n",
    "- **A/AAAA**: Can encode data in IP addresses; detect via pattern and entropy analysis.\n",
    "- **MX/SRV/NS**: Less common in abuse but still possible; investigate unexpected use.\n",
