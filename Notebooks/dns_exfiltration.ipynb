    "# Detecting DNS Exfiltration via Traffic Analytics\n",

    "*\"Most networks let DNS traffic pass without a second thought - and that's exactly what attackers are counting on.\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "DNS exfiltration is a stealthy cyberattack where sensitive data - passwords, source code, or trade secrets - is smuggled out of a network inside DNS queries. Because DNS is rarely blocked or scrutinized, attackers encode payloads into domain lookups and quietly bypass firewalls.\n",
    "This data leakage can include passwords, intellectual property, or other confidential information, sent as parts of DNS query names or payloads. Detecting DNS exfiltration requires looking for unusual patterns such as:\n",
    "Excessively long or random-looking domain names\n",
    "High volumes of DNS queries to suspicious domains\n",
    "Anomalies in query types and response behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll dive into hands-on analytics and visualizations using real PCAP data - and expose how stealthy DNS traffic can reveal a breach in progress."

    "A stealth tunnel that confirms query receipt without revealing actual records\n",

    "In Our Dataset\n",

    "### Static Features\n",
    "- *RCODE patterns*, especially NoError responses with no answers\n",
    "- *Query Length Distribution* - revealing data being encoded in subdomain labels.\n",
    "- *Subdomain cardinality* as a proxy for data encoding activity\n",
    "- *Top queried domains* to isolate suspicious focal points in traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Features\n",
    "- *Time series visualizations* to detect query bursts and irregularities\n",
    "- *Interarrival times* to uncover signs of automated beaconing\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these indicators revealed patterns consistent with stealthy data exfiltration: consistent traffic to obscure domains, unusually high subdomain counts, and tightly timed queries with minimal response data.\n",

    "## What’s Next?\n",
    "In our next post, we’ll take these handcrafted features and explore how to:\n",
    "- Train machine learning models to detect DNS exfiltration automatically\n",
    "- Use both supervised and unsupervised approaches\n",
    "- Apply anomaly detection techniques to real PCAP datasets\n",
