# DNS Exfiltration Detection Using Python and Pandas

This project is a playground for educational purposes. It demonstrates how to detect **DNS-based data exfiltration** using traffic analytics techniques applied to real PCAP data. It includes modular scripts and a Jupyter Notebook that performs parsing, enrichment, statistical analysis, and threat hunting.

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmaosa/dns-exfiltration-analysis.git
cd dns-exfiltration-analysis
```
2. set up and activate virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install notebook dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Launch the notebook:

```bash
cd Notebooks
jupyter lab dns_exfiltration_detection.ipynb
```

## What the Project Does

- Parses DNS traffic from JSON-serialized PCAP files
- Computes several features such as query name entropy and subdomain cardinality
- Analyzes timing patterns and potential beaconing behavior
- Visualizes suspicious patterns in DNS traffic
- Highlights exfiltration indicators (e.g. high cardinality + rcode=0 + no answers)

## Output Highlights

- Inter-request interval histogram
- Mean vs Std Dev scatter plot for beaconing
- Subdomain cardinality pie chart
- Final threat hunting judgment narrative

## Dataset

- **Source**: [CIC-Bell-DNS-EXF-2021](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/dns-exf-2021.html)
- **Used**: Parsed JSON version of DNS traffic from PCAP
